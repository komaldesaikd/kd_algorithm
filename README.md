# kd_algorithm
This code has python solution which returns rectangles overlaps or not overlaps 

##Steps
#Step 1 : python file "rectangle_overlaps.py" has function solution() which takes json input with keys 'A' and 'B' for rectangle names.

#Step 2 : Input json has following format with each rectangle 4 co-ordinates.
#e.g.: inputvalue={"A":[(1,1),(4,1),(1,3),(4,3)],"B":[(1,1),(3,-1),(1,-3),(-1,-1)]}

#Step 3 : Based on input values it will check weather they intersect if yes then returns True or if not intersects then returns False.

#Step 4 : test.py file has 5 cases based on different input values of co-ordinates and it has passed for all cases.
